abstract = {The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine and has been a key factor in the rapid advances in medicine over the last 50 years. The key to a properly conducted RCT is that the sequence generation is properly randomized and that the investigator is not aware what the next sequence will be before the patient is entered into the trial (concealment of allocation). This will ensure that the experimental groups are well balanced for any factors that may influence outcomes of the trial. Ideally participants, healthcare staff, and researchers should be blinded to the intervention being received and there should be minimal loss of follow-up. If this is achieved then biases will be minimized. There are many types of RCTs including parallel group, factorial, cross-over, and cluster randomized trial. The choice of design depends on the setting and the question being evaluated. This edition first published 2014},

@article{Mutz2019,
abstract = {Widespread concern over the credibility of published results has led to scrutiny of statistical practices. We address one aspect of this problem that stems from the use of balance tests in conjunction with experimental data. When random assignment is botched, due either to mistakes in implementation or differential attrition, balance tests can be an important tool in determining whether to treat the data as observational versus experimental. Unfortunately, the use of balance tests has become commonplace in analyses of “clean” data, that is, data for which random assignment can be stipulated. Here, we show that balance tests can destroy the basis on which scientific conclusions are formed, and can lead to erroneous and even fraudulent conclusions. We conclude by advocating that scientists and journal editors resist the use of balance tests in all analyses of clean data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
